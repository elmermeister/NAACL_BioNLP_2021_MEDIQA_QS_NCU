# NAACL_BioNLP_2021_MEDIQA_QS_NCU

This study describes the model design of the NCUEE-NLP system for the MEDIQA challenge at the BioNLP 2021 workshop.
We use the PEGASUS transformers and fine-tune the downstream summarizatio task using our collected and processed datasets. A total of 22 teams participated in the consumer health question summarization task of MEDIQA 2021.
Each participating team was allowed to submit a maximum of ten runs. Our best submission, achieving a ROUGE2-F1 score of 0.1597, ranked third among all 128
submissions.
